   In case you do not know how our GUI handles plugins, please take a quick look at the part
   `Developing Plugins <https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README.html#developing-plugins>`_ in our Readme.

Overview
########

This enables our GUI to load and display your specific type of data, as shown in
`this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSFFSTUM4e0&t=6>`_ form 0:06 to 0:16.
Please additionally take a look at `this GIF <https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/gifs/importer.gif>`_, which shows you how your plugin gets into the GUI.

.. admonition:: Using the working example
   :class: tip

   The subsection below shows a working example, which you can adapt to your case. To run it:

   - create a file as shown in `this image <https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/images/development/importer_create_file.png>`_
   - copy the code snippet containing `CustomImporter` class to the file (see long code snippet in section :ref:`develop custom importer`)
   - download our `example CSV <https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/mad-gui/raw/main/example_data/sensor_data.zip>`_
   - in a separate file execute the following code snippet and then load data as shown in our
     `exemplary video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSFFSTUM4e0&t=6s>`_:

   .. code-block:: python

       from mad_gui import start_gui
       from custom_importer import CustomImporter # you need to create this file and class, see below

       start_gui(plugins=[CustomImporter])

.. _develop custom importer:

Develop your custom importer
############################

After you created an empty file, as described above, copy the code below to it to get started.
If the user selects your CustomImporter, selects a file and then presses `start_processing`, the GUI will pass the
selected file to your `CustomImporter.load_sensor_data` (argument `file_path`), as shown in `this GIF <_static/gifs/importer.gif>`_.

.. admonition:: Adapting the working example
   :class: tip

   To adapt this working example to load your data, just:

   - load data of your system into `sensor_data` and `sampling_rate_hz` in `load_sensor_data`
   - make sure the variable `sensor_data` keeps a dataframe and `sampling_rate_hz` keeps a float

Optionally, you can set the file type that the importer can load, e.g. `*.csv`.
This will restrict which files the user can select.
Also, you can change the importer's name by changing the returned string of the regarding method.
The name will show up in the dropdown menu in the GUI's pop up when the user clicks `Load data`.

.. warning::

   You need to pass your importer to our GUI like this as it is also shown in
   `this image <https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/images/development/importer_pass_to_gui.png>`_:

   .. code-block:: python

      from mad_gui import start_gui
      from custom_importer import CustomImporter

      start_gui(plugins=[CustomImporter])

After you have performed these steps, you can select the importer in the GUI by pressing `Load Data`
and then selecting it in the dropdown on the upper left in the pop-up window.
From user perspective it should work as we have described in our
`exemplary video about loading data <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSFFSTUM4e0&t=6s>`_.

.. note::
    In case loading your file does not work, we recommend to set breakpoints into your loader and check, whether
    everything does what you expect it to do. Also you might want to look at our section about
    :ref:`Troubleshooting development <troubleshooting development>` or at
    `load_sensor_data's documentation <https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/generated/plugins/mad_gui.plugins.BaseFileImporter.html#mad_gui.plugins.BaseFileImporter.load_sensor_data>`_.
