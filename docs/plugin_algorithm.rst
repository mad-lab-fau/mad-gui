   In case you do not know how our GUI handles plugins, please take a quick look at the part
   `Developing Plugins <https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README.html#developing-plugins>`_ in our Readme.

.. _getting started:

Overview
########

.. warning::

   Depending on what your algorithm should do, you will need only one of the two subsections below.

- 1.2 Algorithm, which creates annotations to be plotted:

    - see what that means `in a video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n96eO7TAItg&t=124s>`_ (02:04 to 02:20)
    - use the :ref:`code example <algorithm annotations>`

- 1.3 Algorithm, which calculates features for existing annotations:

    - see what that means `in a video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n96eO7TAItg&t=141s>`_ (02:21 to 02:39)
    - use the :ref:`code example <algorithm features>`

.. admonition:: Using the working example
   :class: tip

   The two subsections below show working examples, which you can adapt for your specific algorithm. To run one of them:

   - create a file as shown in `this image <_static/images/development/algorithm_create_file.png>`_
   - copy one of the code snippets containing the `MyAlgorithm` class to the file (section 1.2 or 1.3)
   - download our `example CSV <https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/mad-gui/raw/main/example_data/sensor_data.zip>`_
   - in a separate file execute the following code snippet and then apply the algorithm as shown in our
     `exemplary video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n96eO7TAItg&t=124s>`_:

   .. code-block:: python

       from mad_gui import start_gui
       from mad_gui.plugins import ExampleFileImporter
       from my_algorithm import MyAlgorithm # you need to create this file and class, see below

       start_gui(plugins=[ExampleFileImporter, MyAlgorithm])

.. _algorithm annotations:

Algorithm, which creates annotations to be plotted
##################################################

A plugin like this can be used to create annotations which span a region between to samples.
Your algorithm may for example be able to find regions where the sensor was not moving.
The GUI will plot the annotations automatically after it returns from your algorithm's `process_data` method.
You can see an example in `this GIF <_static/gifs/algorithm_label.gif>`_ or `this video from 02:04 to 02:20
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n96eO7TAItg&t=124s>`_.

.. admonition:: Adapting the working example
   :class: tip

   The code below is a working example. See :ref:`getting started` for more information on
   how to execute this example. To adapt this example to your use case, you only need to modify the methods
   **name** and **create_annotations** of `MyAlgorithm`.

   If you want to use other labels than the built-in "Activity", make sure to pass it to `start_gui`
   and then you can use it in `process_data` below.

`the regarding documentation <https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/generated/mad_gui/mad_gui.models.local.PlotData.html#mad_gui.models.local.PlotData>`_.
However, you can get along without knowing anything about `Plot Data`:

.. _algorithm features:

Algorithm, which creates features for existing annotations
##########################################################

A plugin like this can be used to calculate features for annotations that are already visible in the GUI.
For example the user might have created annotations manually or by using an algorithm as described in :ref:`algorithm annotations`.

Now, you might want to know the mean value of the sensor signal in each of the annotated regions.
For this task you can create an algorithm as we describe it in this section.
After execution of the algorithm, the GUI will take care for showing the results as soon as the user hovers of the
annotation with the mouse, as you can see in `this GIF <_static/gifs/algorithm_feature.gif>`_ or `this video from 02:21 to 02:39
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n96eO7TAItg&t=141s>`_.
