## Why and what?
Existing graphical user interfaces (GUIs), that deal with time series data, usually do not allow support of annotation 
by algorithms, although such algorithms exist.
If they do, the algorithm and the GUI are tightly coupled, such that reusing it becomes hard.

Furthermore, algorithms that were developed to analyze time series data, can usually not be used by researchers, who do
not have programming experience, although the algorithms were developed for their research area. This is for example the 
case in the area of gait analysis, where algorithms are provided by computer scientists and need to be used by clinical 
researchers.

The MaD GUI can be used as a framework to incorporate algorithms for supporting time series annotation and for using
algorithms for analyzing time series data even without having programming experience. You can read about this in more 
detail in our [Background](#background) section.

## Terminology

| Word | Meaning |
|------|---------|
|Annotation| An annotation has a start and a stop value, e.g. it goes from second 1 to second 2 of the time series data.|
|Label| An annotation is always of a certain type, for example "Activity". These types are called labels. A Label keeps the possible descriptions of an annotation. For example, the label "Activity" can have the descriptions "walk" or "run". Furthermore, it keeps information about where the annotation should be plotted, e.g. lowest 20% of the plot. |
|User| Someone who performs actions in the GUI using the mouse and keyboard.|
|Developer| Someone who creates plugins for the GUI, for example to load a specific data format or to use a specific algorithm.


## User Interface

You can get information on how to use the GUI from the keywords below or from the video referenced in each of the sections.
You may also want to take a look at [ACQ4 documentation](http://acq4.org/documentation/userGuide/userInterface/graphics.html#mouse-interaction) to learn about mouse interaction with the plots (e.g. zooming).

## Load and display data of any format
This will need someone who is familiar with Python, who has to develop a plugin of the type `Importer`.
For more information on how to create plugins, please refer to [Developing Plugins](#developing-plugins).
You do not have experience with python but still want to load data from a specific system? [Contact us!](mailto:malte.ollenschlaeger@fau.de)

## Use a custom algorithm
This will need someone who is familiar with Python, who has to develop a plugin of the type `Algorithm`.
For more information on how to create plugins, please refer to [Developing Plugins](#developing-plugins).
You do not have experience with python but still want to load data from a specific system? [Contact us!](mailto:malte.ollenschlaeger@fau.de)



## Development
In case you experience issues, please try to find a solution in our documentation regarding [Troubleshooting](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html#development).

### Development installation

Info: We recommend to use `pip install mad_gui` in a 
clean python 3.8 [conda environment](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/preparation.html#installing-necessary-software), or if you know what you are doing in a [python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments).
. 

```
pip install mad_gui
```
Then, from your command line simply call:

```
mad-gui
```

Alternatively, within a python script use our [start_gui](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/generated/mad_gui/mad_gui.start_gui.html#mad_gui.start_gui) function: 

```
from mad_gui import start_gui
start_gui()
```

If you want to see an example, [download our example data](#example-data).
Afterwards, you can open the previously downloaded example data as shown in 
[User Interface](#user-interface).
You want to load data of a specific format/system or want to use a specific algorithm? 
In this case please refer to the sections
[Load and display data of a certain data type](#load-and-display-data-of-any-format)
and [Use a custom algorithm](#use-a-custom-algorithm).

### Developing plugins

The MaD GUI package can be extended with different kinds of plugins and labels.
The user can access your plugins within the GUI using dropdowns, after clicking "Load data" or "Use algorithm". 
**However, this is only possible if your plugin was passed to the GUI at startup**, as we show it for an importer 
in [this GIF](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/gifs/importer.gif), or as shown in this code snippet:

```python
from mad_gui import start_gui
from my_importer import MyImporter
from my_algorithm import MyAlgorithm
from my_labels import MyFirstLabel, MySecondLabel

# only passing plugins
start_gui(plugins=[MyImporter, MyAlgorithm])

# passing plugins and labels
start_gui(plugis=[MyImporter], labels=[MyFirstLabel, MySecondLabel])

```

In the sections in the following list we describe how you can develop your own plugins and labels, which must inherit one of our 
[base plugins](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/plugins.html#plugins) or 
[BaseRegionLabel](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/generated/plot_tools/mad_gui.plot_tools.labels.BaseRegionLabel.html#mad_gui.plot_tools.labels.BaseRegionLabel).
**Each of these sections keeps working example to get you started as quick as possible**:

   - Importer: [Load and display data of any format](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin_importer.html#importer)
   - Algorithm: [Create annotations for plotted data](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin_algorithm.html#algorithm)
   - Algorithm: [Calculate features for existing annotations](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin_algorithm.html#algorithm)
   - Exporter: [Export displayed annotations](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin_exporter.html)
   - Labels: [Create one or several custom label classes](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/labels.html)
   - For supplementary basic information please refer to [Preparation](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/preparation.html).

## Communicating with the user

### Pop-up
If - at any point - you want to send a message to the user of the GUI, you create a message box with an OK button like
this:

```python
from mad_gui.components.dialogs.user_information import UserInformation

UserInformation.inform_user("Your message")

# will return PySide2.QtWidgets.QMessageBox.Yes or PySide2.QtWidgets.QMessageBox.No
yes_no = UserInformation().ask_user("Yes or No?") 
```

### Tooltip of labels

You can display results of your algorithms for example by putting the results into the label's description as shown in our section about [custom algorithms](https://mad-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin_algorithm.html#algorithm-which-creates-features-for-existing-annotations).

## Adjusting Constants

You can create your own settings by creating a class, which inherits from our [BaseSettings](https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/mad-gui/blob/main/mad_gui/config/settings.py#L1).
The following example makes use of the BaseSettings and simply overrides some properties:

```python
from mad_gui.config import BaseSettings
from mad_gui import start_gui
   
class MySettings(BaseSettings):
    # decide which axes/channels should be plotted by default
    # Note that this will result in an error if the passed data does not have those axes
    CHANNELS_TO_PLOT = ["acc_x", "acc_z"]
    
    # used if a label has `snap_to_min = True` or `snap_to_max = True`
    SNAP_AXIS = "acc_x"
    SNAP_RANGE_S = 0.2
    
    # in all your labels you can add an event by using `Ctrl` as modifier when in `Add label` mode
    # when adding an event the user will be prompted to select one of these two strings as a
    # `description` for the event
    EVENTS = ["important event", "other type of important event"]
    
    # Set the width of IMU plot to this, when hitting the play button for the video.
    PLOT_WIDTH_PLAYING_VIDEO = 20  # in seconds
    
    # If plotting large datasets, this speeds up plotting, however might result in inaccurate
    # representation of the data
    AUTO_DOWNSAMPLE = True

start_gui(
settings=MySettings,
)

```

## Changing the theme

You can easily change the two dominating colors by passing your own theme to the GUI.

```python
   from mad_gui import start_gui
   from mad_gui.config import BaseTheme
   from PySide2.QtGui import QColor

   class MyTheme(BaseTheme):
      COLOR_DARK = QColor(0, 255, 100)
      COLOR_LIGHT = QColor(255, 255, 255)

   start_gui(
    theme=MyTheme,
   )
```

## Background

### User perspective

#### The challenge
New algorithms for analyzing time series data are published frequently.
However, the developed algorithms can hardly be used if the area of application is outside of computer science.
For example in clinical research, the user likely will lack necessary programming expertise.

#### Best available solutions
Many graphical user interfaces exist, that allow interaction with time series data without programming expertise.
Usually they can be used to annotate sequences of a signal, resulting in information like 
`"from timestamp x to timestamp y, z happend"` or `"at timestamp x, z happened"`.
In case they need a more detailed analysis using a specific kind of algorithm, usually the data has to be sent to
the developer of the specific algorithm, who has to process it and send back the results.

#### Limitations of available solutions
If available graphical user interfaces contain algorithms, these tools are often not open-source and/or require the user
to install software on their machine. The latter is not always easily possible due to restrictions of an institution's 
security policy.
In case an algorithm is not incorporated into a graphical user interface, the user interested in using this 
algorithm would have to send data to developers of the specific algorithm.
This may be undesirable for several reasons.
Among others, data protection laws and the created overhead are important aspects.

As a result, many algorithms are developed to support research fields outside of computer science, as for example 
clinical research, but can hardly be used.

#### Our solution
The MaD GUI offers an easy way of accessing algorithms for the analysis of time series data.
This enables researchers to make use of state-of-the-art-algorithms for time series analysis in their respective 
research area even if they do not have programming expertise.

### Developer perspective

#### The challenge
Researching algorithms for time series data in many cases requires annotation of data.
To accomplish the task of annotation, developers usually need some kind of graphical user interface.

#### Best available solutions
While many graphical user interface exist for annotating time series data, they usually do not incorporate algorithms, 
which could support the developer with labelling the data - and they do not offer an interface to add algorithms.
However, many algorithms exist for such kind of support.

#### Limitations of avaialable solutions
In case a graphical user interface incorporates algorithms to support labelling, these are often very specific to the 
use-case.
This results in each developer building their own graphical user interface, which usually is not developed
with the aim of being modular or to be used in other projects.
Therefore, there is a lot of work done over and over again.

#### Our solution
The MaD GUI offers a basis for such scenarios.
It can be extended by developers to load their specific data format.
Furthermore, developers can easily inject their algorithms to support labelling or analyze time series data as a plugin.
In addition, developers can specify the labels to be used - it could be one layer (= one label from top to bottom) or 
an arbitrary amount of layers, (e.g. use one kind of label in the upper part of the plot and another kind of label in 
the lower part of the plot).
During annotation, each label can easily be assigned an additional description to add details to the specific 
annotation.
