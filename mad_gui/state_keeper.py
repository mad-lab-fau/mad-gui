    Attributes
    ----------

        The frame that is shown by :class:`mad_gui.VideoWindow`
    label_state
        One of the states "add", "remove", "edit", or "investigate". State information is color-coded by the buttons
        in the
        upper part of the GUI. Can be changed by mouse-click or shortcuts "a", "e", or "Esc".
    gui_has_unsaved_changes

        :meth:`mad_gui.MainWindow._export` or saved using :meth:`mad_gui.MainWindow._save_data_gui_format`.
